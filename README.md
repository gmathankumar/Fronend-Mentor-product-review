## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- grid


### What I learned

For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the image to swap for different media screen sizes.

At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used.
Always open to any comments


```css
.image-content {
    height: 239px;
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
    background-image: url("./images/image-product-mobile.jpg");
    background-position: top center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
}

```

### Continued development

I would like to reuse the product preview component in any of my upcoming projects.
